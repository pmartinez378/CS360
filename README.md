Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The JustWeight app was developed to help users track their daily weight, set and reach health goals, and receive notifications when they achieve their target weight. The app's main goals were to make weight tracking simple, encourage users through notifications, and provide a secure environment for storing and accessing weight data. Designed for ease of use, it addresses user needs for consistent motivation, straightforward data logging, and secure access to personal data.

2. What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

To meet user needs, the app required several core screens: a login screen to ensure data privacy, a data entry screen for daily weight logs, a grid view to display and track weight over time, and a goal notification screen to alert users when they hit their targets. The UI was created with simplicity and clarity in mind; familiar layout patterns and responsive elements made the navigation intuitive and allowed users to focus on tracking progress without distraction. This design was successful because it prioritized accessibility and made the app feel approachable, even for users who may not be tech-savvy.

3. How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

My coding approach focused on modularity, which involved breaking down each feature—such as data management, activity navigation, and SMS notifications—into separate components. This strategy made testing and debugging more manageable and promoted clean, maintainable code. By structuring the app in this way, I could make isolated improvements without affecting other components, a technique I plan to continue using for scalability and efficient maintenance in future projects.

4. How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

To verify functionality, I conducted unit tests on each component and performed end-to-end testing of the user flows to confirm that features worked as intended. This testing process was critical, as it helped me catch minor bugs early and ensured that the app met its requirements reliably. It revealed areas where functionality could be optimized, particularly in data handling and activity navigation, which I adjusted for smoother performance.

5. Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

One challenge was achieving a smooth transition of data between activities. To overcome this, I refined data handling methods, particularly in the database and activity communication, to streamline the transfer of information without disrupting user flow. This required innovative adjustments in how the app’s components interacted, ultimately resulting in a more seamless user experience.

6. In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

The data management component, specifically the DBHelper class, was where I demonstrated my skills most effectively. Creating a reliable, efficient system for secure data storage and retrieval while ensuring smooth integration with the UI highlighted my ability to design a functional backend that supports user needs. This component was crucial in providing the backbone of the app’s data storage and was pivotal for ensuring data integrity and ease of access.
